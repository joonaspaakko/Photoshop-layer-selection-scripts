## basic

These scripts are pretty much just a way use existing layer selection functionality that is blocked in certain keyboards. It's all just scripting listener scripts... 

> Except for `Select Next Layer (invisible or not).jsx` and `Select parent group.jsx` which add new functionality. Note that the advanced folder has a slightly more advanced version of that the select parent group script.

## advanced

All of these scripts also work with multiple group layers. For example if you select two separate groups and run `Select Children.jsx`, it selects the child layers in both groups.
